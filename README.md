# cargo-arc

[![CI](https://github.com/seflue/cargo-arc/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/seflue/cargo-arc/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Generates a collapsible arc diagram of your Cargo workspace as SVG.
You get a tree of your crates and their modules, connected by arcs
that trace `use` dependencies between them.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/seflue/cargo-arc
```

Requires a stable Rust toolchain.

## Quick Start

```bash
# In any Cargo workspace:
cargo arc -o deps.svg
```

Open the generated SVG in a browser.

## What You See

Your workspace shows up as a tree — crates with their modules nested inside.
Arcs between nodes show where dependencies exist.

- **Boxes** — crates and modules, nested by hierarchy
- **Arcs** — dependencies between any two nodes
- **Collapse** a node to fold its children — individual dependencies merge into summary arcs
- **Select** a node or arc to highlight its relationships
- **Cycles** — circular dependencies are detected and highlighted

## Features

- **Cross-crate module dependencies** — traces `use` dependencies across the whole workspace at module level
- **Feature filtering** — show only crates involved in a specific Cargo feature
- **Interactive SVG** — collapse, expand, and select directly in the browser
- **Volatility report** — identifies frequently-changed modules based on git history

### Feature Filtering

Show only the dependency subgraph for a specific Cargo feature:

```bash
# Show crates involved in the "web" feature (includes default deps)
cargo arc --features web -o web-deps.svg

# Exclude default deps — show ONLY the "web" feature graph
cargo arc --features web --no-default-features -o web-deps.svg
```

### Volatility Report

Analyze which modules changed most frequently over the last months:

```bash
cargo arc --volatility
```

Useful for identifying hotspots before refactoring. The analysis period
and thresholds are configurable (`--volatility-months`, `--volatility-low`,
`--volatility-high`).

## Development

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for project structure and architecture decision records.

Requires [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) as task runner.

```bash
just build
just test    # Rust + JS
just lint    # clippy + format check
just fmt
```
