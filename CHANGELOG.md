## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Single-file crates rendered in workspace diagrams

### Changed
- Node and arc filter toggling unified
- Shared show logic extracted in sidebar
- Shared arc-row logic extracted in cycle sidebar
- Layer dispatch replaced with table lookup
- Virtual arcs rendered in single pass
- Redundant no-op wrappers removed, accessor methods introduced
- `classList.toggle` used instead of manual class manipulation

### Fixed
- Single-file crates invisible in workspace diagrams (anchor detection required Contains-edges)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- `--expand-level` flag to start with deeper modules pre-collapsed
- External dependency visualization with `--externals` flag
- `--transitive-deps` flag to include transitive external dependencies
- Direct vs transitive dependency distinction (separate visual styling)
- Sidebar shows external dependencies as flat rows with pill-styled badges
- Click sidebar badges to navigate to the corresponding graph node
- Toggle (+/−) on sidebar node badges for expand/collapse
- Sidebar refreshes when nodes are expanded or collapsed
- Search dimming extended to arcs and external dependency nodes
- Toolbar toggle for transitive dependency filtering

### Changed
- Sidebar entries sorted by tree position
- Sidebar styling aligned with tree nodes (font-weight, badge widths)
- Sidebar hides during navigation scroll
- Toolbar checkboxes moved into dropdown menu

### Fixed
- SVG viewport clipping after expand/collapse
- Missing arcs after expanding all initially collapsed nodes
- Sidebar collapse broken with external dependencies present
- Sidebar scroll jitter on short navigation jumps
- Sidebar flicker during badge navigation scroll
- Sidebar collapse-all needing two clicks
- Collapse-all action not matching button label
- Missing selection styling on sidebar header
- Phantom highlight after background deselect
- Hover lag during active search
- Toolbar overflowing browser viewport width
- Dimmed nodes not clickable when pinned
- Sidebar not filling available viewport height

### Performance
- DOM element cache for O(1) hover lookups
- Debounced hover highlights to reduce render churn
- Cached filter-hidden node set per toggle cycle
- Diff-based search highlight updates (skip stable matches)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-23

Initial public release.

### Added
- Interactive workspace dependency visualization as arc diagram
- Collapsible crates and parent modules
- Highlight relationships on hover and click
- Symbol-level tooltips (imported symbols per dependency)
- Cross-crate dependency edges via `syn`-based `use` statement parsing
- Feature-based dependency graph filtering
- Cycle detection via Johnson's algorithm with badge navigation
- Search with dimming of non-matching nodes
- HTML report generation (single self-contained file)
