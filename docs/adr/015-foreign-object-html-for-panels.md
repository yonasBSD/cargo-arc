# ADR-015: Use foreignObject HTML for SVG Panels

- **Status:** Active
- **Decided:** 2026-01-31

## Context

Interactive UI elements (sidebar with collapse, scroll, text selection) need HTML features that SVG-native elements do not provide. Standalone SVG has no surrounding HTML document — an HTML overlay is not possible.

## Decision

We render UI panels as HTML inside SVG `foreignObject` elements.

## Rationale

SVG renders the graph, but code references are text — and text is easier to style with the CSS box model in HTML than in native SVG. Since cargo-arc produces a self-contained SVG file, we embed HTML via foreignObject. JavaScript manipulates the DOM for interactivity.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Flexbox, scrolling, text selection in panels
- Consistent with self-contained SVG (no external HTML wrapper)

### Negative
- foreignObject support varies between SVG viewers (browsers OK, some tools not)
- CSS isolation between SVG and HTML requires care
